"""Lightweight circuit breaker for external SQLServer (U8/PDM) calls.

Provides failure isolation: when a backend (e.g. U8 BOM query) starts timing out
(error 20003) or refusing connections, the breaker opens and fast-fails subsequent
calls instead of queuing them on worker threads for the full 120s query timeout.
This prevents cascading stalls across the quotation pipeline.

Design:
- States: CLOSED (normal) -> OPEN (fast-fail) -> HALF_OPEN (probe).
- Counts consecutive failures; on reaching threshold, opens for `open_sec`.
- After `open_sec`, one trial call is allowed (HALF_OPEN); success closes,
  failure re-opens. Concurrent trial calls during HALF_OPEN are fast-failed.
- Thread-safe (worker threads share one breaker per backend).
