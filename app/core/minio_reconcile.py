"""MinIO orphan reconciliation: scan bucket prefixes vs DB and delete unreferenced objects.

This is the safety net beneath all the per-path cleanup. Even with the upload-path
compensation and worker cleanup, some objects can still slip through (crashes between
upload and DB commit, OCR image_upload which never writes a DB row, closing_form
uploads that are never submitted). The sweep lists objects under high-churn prefixes
(``temp/``, ``images/``, ``form_pic/``), excludes any object whose path is registered
in the DB (FileResource + QuotationTask), and deletes the rest — but only if the
object is older than a grace window (so in-flight uploads whose DB row has not
committed yet are not误删).

Safety properties:
- Grace window (MINIO_RECONCILE_GRACE_SEC): only objects with last_modified older
  than now - grace are candidates. New uploads are protected.
- DB snapshot: all registered paths are read once per run into a set; an object is
  deleted only if its path is NOT in that set.
- Dry-run friendly: logs every deletion; never raises (best-effort).
