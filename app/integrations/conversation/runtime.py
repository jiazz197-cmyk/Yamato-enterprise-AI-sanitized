"""Process-wide shared runtime resources for the conversation workflow.

These are singletons shared across all concurrent conversation turns:

- **LLM clients** (``ChatOpenAI``): each wraps an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` whose
  connection pool is coroutine-safe and reusable. Sharing one instance means
  TCP connections to vLLM are pooled and reused across users, instead of being
  re-handshaked on every request (which is what happened when the pipeline
  ``new``-ed three clients per turn).

- **``asyncio.Semaphore``** per model: bounds in-flight LLM calls so a burst of
  users cannot exhaust vLLM or balloon memory. The (N+1)-th caller simply
  awaits a slot; on cancel or completion the slot is released (``async with``
  unwinds). The 8B pool is shared by keyword extraction + intent enhancement;
  the 35B pool gates the streaming answer.

- **Dedicated retrieval ``ThreadPoolExecutor``**: the RAG ``retriever.get_response``
  is synchronous/blocking (embedding + vector store). Running it on the default
  asyncio executor would let conversation retrieval starve — and be starved by
  — every other ``to_thread`` / ``run_in_executor`` call in the process. A
  dedicated bounded pool isolates it with its own backpressure: the pool's
  ``max_workers`` is the hard cap on concurrent retrievals; extras queue.

``ChatOpenAI`` holds **no conversation state** — the messages are passed per
``ainvoke``/``astream`` call and discarded afterward — so sharing the instance
across users does not mix conversations (same model as a shared DB engine).
